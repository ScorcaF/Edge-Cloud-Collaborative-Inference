# Edge-Cloud-Collaborative-Inference
Collaborative Inference framework with the following components: 
    (i) a Fast inference pipeline running on edge;
    (ii) a Slow inference pipeline running on the cloud;
    (iii) a “success checker” policy to determine whether the Fast inference was “confident” about its prediction or not; if not, run the Slow inference to get the final     prediction.
