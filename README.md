# Edge-Cloud-Collaborative-Inference
Collaborative Inference framework with the following components: (i) a Fast inference pipeline running on edge (ii) a Slow inference pipeline running on the cloud (iii) a “success checker” policy to determine whether the Fast inference was “confident” about its prediction or not; if not, run the Slow inference to get the final prediction.
